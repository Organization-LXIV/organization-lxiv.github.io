## 1.1.a Blender
First, Blender is needed. It's recomended to use Blender 4, but we have had better luck on [Blender 3.6 LTS](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-6).

Start by downloading the latest version of [Fast64 Gart Edition](https://github.com/ManIsCat2/Fast64-Gart).\
Press the blue code button, then press Download Zip.\
[...or just press this link to do the same thing.](https://github.com/ManIsCat2/Fast64-Gart/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Now open up Blender into a new empty project.\
In the top left beside File, press Edit.\
Then press Preferences.\
In the new window, press the Add-Ons tab.\
Click the Install button in the top left and choose the newly downloaded Fast64-Gart ZIP file.\
It's a good idea to restart Blender after this point.

#### Tip:
If you are having issues with Fast64-Gart and you know it's not you, try reinstalling it.
