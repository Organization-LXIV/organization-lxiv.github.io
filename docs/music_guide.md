# Making Custom SM64 Music
My team and I figured this shit out from 7 year old tutorials at 3 in the morning.\
Do note that this is primarily for Super Mario 64 Coop Deluxe!\
Let's go through the process.

## Part 1: Setup FL Project
Get your SM64 MIDI, any will do that contains the same-ish instruments.\

Just make sure that you name your instruments to what they're supposed to represent.\
E.g. ```Electric Piano```

## Part 2: Make Your Beat
You're limited to a polyphony limit of 3 per channel. (I COULD be WRONG!)

Start by going to your soundfont player and click on the gear option, then the revealed wrench icon.\

Then set the polyphony setting to 3.

Make sure to set the track for each instrument.

You only get 15 midi tracks.\
A trick to bypass the polyphony limit is to split your complex chords up into two dupe instruments on separate tracks.

## Part 3: Prepare to Export from FL Studio

## Part 4: Convert the MIDI to M64

## Part 5: Put the Song Into The Game
This is where the tutorial deviates for SM64.\
This is for sm64coopdx, NOT the ROM.\
